 ,What ,Why , we know you have a lot of questions. We will try to  answer as
much as we can.
Please feel free to ask questions that you get an answer to Here.

So let's start
Q1.     Who are we?

Ans :
We are a group of students from BVCOE who use Linux, and really like using it.

Q2: Fine ,but there are so many groups already , why start another one?

Ans :
 Good question, but you see , this was needed,let us tell you why.
 First of all , it's not your *standard*  group ,it's a Linux user group,we
 suggest that you go through the wiki. We are here with very particular goals : 

	*Encourage the use of Linux amongst the students.
	
	*Encourage the use of Free and Open Source software in our labs.
	
	
So we are really not one_fest_in_one_year types, we have a very particular
goal, and you are all invited to help and learn.


Q3:  That's all fine , but i have never really used anything besides Windows
ever,so can i join?
Ans :  
To begin with ,that's absolutely fine. We will help you in getting started. 
In fact, installing a parallel Linux distribution is extremely easy these days.
We suggest that you start with {Decide a beginner distro} .
